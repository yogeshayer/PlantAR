# PlantAR: An Interactive Learning Tool  

## Overview  
PlantAR is an Augmented Reality (AR) mobile application designed to help **elementary and middle school students (ages 8–14)** learn plant biology in an engaging, hands-on way. By pointing their mobile device at a target image, students can view and interact with a **3D model of a plant** — rotating, zooming, and tapping on different parts (roots, stem, leaves, flowers) to reveal names and functions.

##  Problem Statement  
Traditional textbooks often use static images to teach complex biological structures, which can fail to engage students. PlantAR solves this by offering a **3D interactive AR experience**, making learning more **memorable, intuitive, and effective**.  

##  Current Status  
- **Sprint 0**: Completed (requirements gathered, project environment setup, repo initialized).  
- **Sprint 1**: Starting (focus: basic image tracking and initial 3D model rendering).  

##  System Requirements  
- **Mobile Device**: iOS (ARKit 4.0+, iPhone 8+) or Android (ARCore 1.0+ supported devices).  
- **Development Platform**: Unity 2021.3 LTS or later.  
- **AR Framework**: AR Foundation, ARKit, ARCore.  
- **Assets**: 3D plant models and target images for tracking.  

##  Features (MVP)  
- **F1**: Image Tracking (recognize physical target image).  
- **F2**: 3D Model Rendering (plant model locked to target).  
- **F3**: Model Manipulation (rotate/zoom).  
- **F4**: Interactive Parts (tap on plant parts).  
- **F5**: Information Display (popup with names & functions).  

Future features include multiple plant models (F8) and teacher preview mode (F9).  

##  Setup Instructions  
1. Install **Unity 2021.3 LTS** (or later).  
2. Add **AR Foundation**, **ARKit XR Plugin**, and **ARCore XR Plugin** via Unity Package Manager.  
3. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd PlantAR

##  Sprint 0 Deliverables
- Repo created with README, license, and .gitignore.  
- Trello board created with columns: Icebox | Backlog | Sprint 0 – To Do | In Progress | In Review | Done.  
- Sprint 0 cards populated (Charter, Roles, Repo setup, Requirements, Zoom).  
- Zoom recurring link added for team sync + instructor meetings.
