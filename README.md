# PlantAR

An augmented reality plant education app for iOS. Students scan physical plant reference cards with their iPhone camera to trigger interactive 3D AR models. Each model supports part-level tapping (Stem, Root, Leaves, Flowers) to display educational information. A teacher dashboard tracks student engagement and scan analytics across the class.

Built as a University of North Texas CSSE 4901 Capstone project by Team Tier1X.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yogeshayer/PlantAR.git
```

Open `PlantAR/PlantAR.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Wait for Xcode to finish downloading the Firebase Swift Package dependencies (1–2 minutes).

### 2. Connect your iPhone

Connect your iPhone via USB. When prompted **"Trust This Computer?"**, tap **Trust** and enter your passcode. Select your iPhone as the target device in the Xcode toolbar.

### 3. Sign with your Apple ID

In Xcode: select the **PlantAR** project → **Signing & Capabilities** → set **Team** to your personal Apple ID.

### 4. Run

Press **▶ Run**. Xcode compiles and installs the app. If prompted on the iPhone, go to **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management** and trust the developer certificate.

### 5. Re-signing (every 7 days)

Free Apple ID provisioning profiles expire every 7 days. Reconnect the iPhone and press **▶ Run** again — app data is fully preserved.

## First-Time Setup

### Teacher
1. Open PlantAR → **I'm a Teacher**
2. Register with email and password
3. A unique class code is automatically generated — share it with students

### Student
1. Open PlantAR → **I'm a Student**
2. Register with email, password, and the class code from your teacher

---

## Using AR

1. Open the **AR tab**
2. Point the camera at a printed reference card (10 cm × 14 cm)
3. The 3D plant model appears anchored to the card
4. Tap individual parts (Stem, Root, Leaves, Flowers) to view educational info
5. Scan records sync automatically to Firebase

## Firebase

The Firebase project is pre-configured — `GoogleService-Info.plist` is bundled in the app. No manual Firebase setup is needed. Firestore collections are created automatically on first sign-up.

---

## Notes

- The Perenual API key is stored in `Info.plist` (`PerenualAPIKey`). Rotate before any public distribution.
- AR reference card images must be printed at 10 cm × 14 cm for correct scale detection.
- 15 plants in the library do not have USDZ models — AR is silently skipped for those.
